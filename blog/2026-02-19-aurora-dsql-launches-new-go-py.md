# Aurora DSQL launches new Go, Python, and Node.js connectors that simplify IAM authentication

<p>Today we are announcing the release of Aurora DSQL Connectors for Go (pgx), Python (asyncpg), and Node.js (WebSocket for Postgres.js) that simplify IAM authentication for customers using standard PostgreSQL drivers to connect to Aurora DSQL clusters. These connectors act as transparent authentication layers that automatically handle IAM token generation, eliminating the need to write token generation code or manually supply IAM tokens. Tokens are automatically generated for each connection, ensuring valid tokens are always used while maintaining full compatibility with existing PostgreSQL driver features. The Postgres.js connector additionally supports WebSocket protocol, enabling customers to connect to DSQL clusters in environments where TCP connections are not available.<br /> <br /> These connectors streamline authentication and eliminate security risks associated with traditional user-generated passwords. All three connectors support custom IAM credential providers, giving customers flexibility in how they manage their AWS credentials.<br /> <br /> To get started, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/SECTION_connectors.html">Connectors for Aurora DSQL documentation</a> page.
