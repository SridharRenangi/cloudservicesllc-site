# Amazon CloudWatch Logs announces increased query result limits

<p>Amazon CloudWatch Logs now supports retrieving up to 100,000 results using the Logs Insights query language. Customers can specify the limit in their query using the LIMIT command.<br /> <br /> Previously, customers were limited to 10,000 results and had to split their queries into smaller time ranges to retrieve all results. With this launch, customers can view a larger set of results and use existing features such as patterns, visualization, and export on the full 100,000 result set. The GetQueryResults API has also been updated to support pagination; each invocation can return up to 10,000 results along with a token that can be used to fetch the next set of results.<br /> <br /> The increased query result limits are available in all commercial AWS regions. You can execute queries and view up to 100,000 results using the Amazon CloudWatch console, AWS CLI, AWS CDK, and AWS SDKs.
