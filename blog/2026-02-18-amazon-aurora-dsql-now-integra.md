# Amazon Aurora DSQL now integrates with Kiro powers and AI agent skills

<p>Today, AWS announces Amazon Aurora DSQL integration with Kiro powers and AI agent skills, enabling developers to build Aurora DSQL-backed applications faster with AI agent-assisted development. These integrations bundle the Aurora DSQL Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with development best practices, so AI agents can help you with Aurora DSQL schema design, performance optimization, and database operations out of the box.<br /> <br /> Kiro powers is a registry of curated and pre-packaged MCP servers, steering files, and agent hooks to accelerate specialized software development and deployment use cases. With the Kiro power for Aurora DSQL, agents have instant access to specialized knowledge, so developers can work confidently without any prior context, reducing trial-and-error development cycles. The power is available within the <a href="https://kiro.dev/launch/powers/amazon-aurora-dsql/">Kiro IDE</a> for one-click installation.<br /> <br /> The <a href="https://skills.sh/awslabs/mcp/dsql">Aurora DSQL skill</a> extends the same capabilities to additional AI coding agents through the <a href="https://skills.sh/docs/cli">Skills CLI</a>. Developers can install the skill with a single command and select their preferred agents including Kiro CLI, Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf, Roo, OpenCode, and more. When developers work on database tasks, the agent dynamically loads relevant skill guidance, including Aurora DSQL Postgres-compatible SQL patterns, distributed database design, and IAM authentication, eliminating the need to repeatedly provide the same context across conversations.&nbsp;As Aurora DSQL adds new features, future skill releases will include updated patterns and guidance, ensuring that agents always have current best practices.</p>
