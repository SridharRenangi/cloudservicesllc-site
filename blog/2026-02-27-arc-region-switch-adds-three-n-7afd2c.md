# ARC Region switch adds three new capabilities: post-recovery workflows, RDS orchestration and AWS provider support for Terraform

<p>Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Region switch helps customers orchestrate the failover of their multi-Region applications to achieve a bounded recovery time in the event of a Regional impairment. It automates multi-Region disaster recovery, reducing engineering effort and eliminating operational overhead when recovering applications across multiple AWS accounts and Regions. Region switch now includes three new capabilities: post-recovery workflows, native RDS execution blocks, and AWS provider for Terraform support.<br /> <br /> <b>Post-recovery workflows.</b> Disaster recovery doesn't end when customers failover to a standby Region. After orchestrating a failover or failback, customers must prepare the other Region for the next recovery event. Today, this requires manual coordination of scaling, recreating read replicas, and validating configurations. Post-recovery workflows help customers automate these preparation steps. With this launch, post-recovery workflows support the custom action Lambda execution block, Amazon RDS create read replica execution block, ARC Region switch plan execution block, and the manual approval execution block. Customers can create read replicas, run custom logic via Lambda functions, add manual approval gates, and embed child plans for complex orchestration as part of post-recovery. Post-recovery workflows are available for active/passive deployments and can be triggered manually.<br /> <br /> <b>RDS execution blocks.</b> Coordinating Amazon RDS database recovery during Regional failover requires manual steps to promote read replicas and recreate replication, introducing delays and errors. Region switch now natively supports two Amazon RDS execution blocks that automate RDS recovery orchestration. The RDS promote read replica execution block orchestrates promotion of a read replica to a standalone instance during failover. The RDS create read replica execution block orchestrates replica creation as part of post-recovery workflows.<br /> <br /> <b>AWS provider for Terraform support.</b> Region switch is now supported by the AWS provider for Terraform, enabling customers to manage disaster recovery plans as Infrastructure-as-Code and integrate them into CI/CD pipelines alongside application deployments.</p>
