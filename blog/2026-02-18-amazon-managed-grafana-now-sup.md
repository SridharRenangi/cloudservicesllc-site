# Amazon Managed Grafana now supports AWS KMS customer managed keys

<p>Amazon Managed Grafana now supports customer-managed keys (CMK) through AWS Key Management Service (KMS), enabling you to encrypt data stored in&nbsp;in your Amazon Managed Grafana workspaces with your own encryption keys. Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed service based on open-source Grafana that makes it easier for you to visualize and analyze your operational data at scale.</p> 
<p>Amazon Managed Grafana provides encryption at rest using AWS owned keys by default. With this launch, you now have an option to use a customer-managed key when creating an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace. This allows you to add a self-managed security layer, helping you meet your organization’s compliance and regulatory requirements.</p> 
<p>This feature is now available in all regions where Amazon Managed Grafana is generally available, except in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.&nbsp;To get started with Amazon Managed Grafana, refer&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/what-is-Amazon-Managed-Service-Grafana.html" target="_blank">Amazon Managed Grafana user guide</a>.
